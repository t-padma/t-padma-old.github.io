Work done during spring 2020 (Jan 3, 2020 to June 9, 2020).

The focus of this project was to learn some elementary causal inference involving two variables. “Elements of causal inference” by Jonas Peters et. al. has been used as the primary reference for this project. I learned about Structural Equation Models (SEMs) and the assumptions or restrictions under which these SEMs are identifiable i.e. cause and effect variables can be identified or distinguished using the joint distribution alone. Causal models LiNGAM and ANM were emphasized more than PNL and IGCI models.
