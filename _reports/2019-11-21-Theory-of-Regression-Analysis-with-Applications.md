Work done during fall 2019 (July 23, 2019 to November 15, 2019).

Regression analysis is a branch of statistics that provides us with tools to model a relationship between variables. In this project, I learned about two types of regression models: the linear regression and non-parametric regression. Linear regression analysis aims to fit a linear model to our data with the help of Least Square Estimates. For this model, I read about the techniques for checking the appropriateness of the model, the tests for determining the significance of regressor variables, the methods for dealing with multi-collinearity, and the procedure for incorporating categorical (or qualitative) variables into our regression model. I also studied a few topics from non-parametric regression, like density estimation and smoothing. Most of the concepts were illustrated in R using real-life data-sets taken from R. 

The main references for this project were the books:
* "Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis" by *Montgomery et. al.* for simple and multiple linear regression, model adequacy checking, transformations, weighted least squares and multicollinearity.
* "Nonparametric Statistical Methods" by *Myles Hollander et. al.* for a little bit of non-parametric regression (the chapters on "Density Estimation" and "Smoothing")
