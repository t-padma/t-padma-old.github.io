Work done during fall 2019 (July 23, 2019 to November 15, 2019).

The focus of this project was to learn the techniques of handling genetic data arising from the population-based study of unrelated individuals. The main reference was the book "Applied Statistical Genetics with R" by Andrea S. Foulkes, and I read the chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 (half of it) and 6 from this book.
