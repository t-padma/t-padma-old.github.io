Work done during summer 2018 (May 21, 2018 to July 15, 2018).

Finite geometry is the study of geometries in which every entity of the geometry is finite in number. (Entities like points, lines, planes...etc). It is a branch of combinatorics. Here we ignore the ideas like continuity, distance, betweeness
etc and only concentrate about incidence i.e. which point is on which line or which line is on which plane etc. The main reference for this project was the lecture notes by Prof. E. Moorhouse, [available here](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2016/incidence_geometry.pdf).
