Work done during winter 2019 (Dec 9, 2019 to Dec 29, 2019).

I learned about Bayesian inference, ANOVA, various kinds of non-parametric tests, goodness of fit tests and their implementation in R following the chapters  "Bayesian Estimation Inference" , "Non-Parametric Tests", "ANOVA" and "Goodness of Fit Tests Applications" from the book "Mathematical Statistics with Applications" by Ramachandran and Tsokos.
