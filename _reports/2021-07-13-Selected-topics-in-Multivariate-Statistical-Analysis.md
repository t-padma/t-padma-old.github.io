Work done during fall 2020 and spring 2021 (September 14, 2020 to July 13, 2021).

The focus of the thesis was to learn and implement different multivariate statistical techniques. In addition to understanding principal component analysis, a dimension reduction technique, an emphasis was placed on learning classification techniques like Linear, Quadratic \& Fisher Discriminant Analysis, Classification and regression trees (CART), and Artificial Neural Networks. The primary reference for the thesis was the book ''Modern Multivariate Statistical Techniques'' by Alan J. Izenman. However, several other references were used as well to get a better understanding of the topics being studied.
