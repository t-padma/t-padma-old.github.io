Work done during spring 2020 (Jan 3, 2020 to June 9, 2020).

Studied elementary causal inference with the emphasis on bi-variate structural equation models by following the book “Elements of Causal Inference” by Jonas Peters et.al. I learned about causal models like LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Additive Noise Model) and bi-variate ANM (Additive Noise model) in detail. I have a brief understanding of IGCI models (Information geometric causal infernce model) and PNL (Post non-linear model). These models help identify causal structure of the phenomena under consideration using the joint density alone. I leaned about the n-variable LiNGAM model although most of what I learned was for two variables.
